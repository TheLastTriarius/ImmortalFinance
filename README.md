# **Usecases**

- Derivatives: If Alice holds Opyn put options it’s obvious to use them as protection layer because they grow as ETHdr ops

- Pools,sets,portfolios - DeFi users like uniswap and balancer pools and they want to use them as protection layer

- Sometimes you don’t have tokens for seling. So you sell your collateral and pay your debt, repeat 5 times. Flash loans to the rescue! You can use rebalancing in manual and automated modes
